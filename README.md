This project is a game made with original content. 
This game will be a murder mystery kind of game, involving a murder and a suspect to the murder. You, the host of the party, have to find out the murder. 
This is only a one player game and it will only have two endings, (Either you find the suspect or accuse an innocent person)
There should be dictionaries for every thing in order to keep everything organized (For example: Rooms should have been organized and carry people, which should carry items, which should have text within them that will either contain clues or nonsense. 
    (Maybe)  Apply the pause function that was given to me in class and in order to make the reader have some mobility while playing the game
        If this is applied into the game, it should have the word (Press Enter to Continute) so that the player would know to end the text and move onto another piece of text

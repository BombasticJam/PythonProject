This project is a game made with original content. 
This game will be a murder mystery kind of game, involving a murder and a suspect to the murder. You, the host of the party, have to find out the murder. 
This is only a one player game and it will only have two endings, (Either you find the suspect or accuse an innocent person)
There should be dictionaries for every thing in order to keep everything organized (For example: Rooms should have been organized and carry people, which should carry items, which should have text within them that will either contain clues or nonsense. 
    (Maybe)  Apply the pause function that was given to me in class and in order to make the reader have some mobility while playing the game
        If this is applied into the game, it should have the word (Press Enter to Continute) so that the player would know to end the text and move onto another piece of text
 # Ingame Data
 
 Starts off by the player needing to enter your name
  Next, it will introduce the player to the party and the event that is going on
        (Maybe) It will introduce some backstory and the characters that were in the party 
   Then the murder happens in the kitchen 
     Some of the items there that the victim (Name will be decided during the making of the game) has in hand **
        # The victim will carry an invitation card (To the party), a red plasic cup (Which would hold thy beer or whatever he was drinking), a necklace which he/she will be wearing around their neck (will have a picture of someone inside of it), and a note which he has made himself (This note will be Tampered with during the making of the game to either improve the game or to give it a more deeper meaning)
  The player should be given an option to choose what rooms to enter in (Rooms such as the bathroom, living room, etc.)
     The player should then be able to choose a person within the room and see there items
       The player should then be able to select an item and see what it is or what it has within it (Writing on it, etc.)
         If the player didnt' mean to select something, then there should be an option to back out of the rooms/person/items so that they're able to choose another choice
   A function to accuse a person should be available (Not during the first parts of the game but midway into the game when the player is given some info)
